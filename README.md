# Negative Speech Detection using LSTM (Natural Language Processing)
Developed a Negative Speech Detection System utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in conjunction with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system is designed to identify negative speech by leveraging key NLP processes such as  stopword removal, and lemmatization to enhance textual representation and model efficiency.

Additionally, the system integrates softmax activation functions , ensuring accurate sentiment categorization.
