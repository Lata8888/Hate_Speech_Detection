# Negative Speech Detection using LSTM (NLP)
Developed a Negative Speech Detection System utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in conjunction with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system is designed to identify negative speech by leveraging key NLP processes such as  stopword removal, and lemmatization to enhance textual representation and model efficiency.
Additionally, the system integrates softmax activation function , ensuring accurate speech detection.
